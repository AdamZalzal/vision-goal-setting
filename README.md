# Vision

Reach your goals one step at a time!

## Description

Vision is a goal setting app that allows you to track and achieve your goals. By breaking down goals into digestible milestones and tasks, Vision allows you to chip away at the most ambitious goals. When you're ready to get to work simply start a work session and input how much time you intend to work for. Vision will then generate a list of tasks that fit in the timespan you've specified. Mark tasks as completed when you're finished and watch as you inch closer to achieving your goals!
